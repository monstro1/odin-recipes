Hola, Odin. Ya he sabido HTML pero me has dicho que todavía yo debería hacer tu
tarea.

This was an interesting little experiment. I'm already very familiar with html
and will probably make some changes or add styling to the pages just for the
fun of it. This lesson really taught me how to use git. I imagine I'll look
back on this in the future and cringe at the number of commits. I don't know if
I'm committing too often or not often enough.

...and what do you know, they asked me to add the CSS just as I was thinking I
would add it myself. Kind of just ripping off the styling of my own website
(with the big blocks for sections). I'll have to think of some more creative
ways to style stuff in the future...
